# 🏷️ Image Tagging with TensorFlow

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a model for automatic image tagging using TensorFlow. The goal is to classify and tag images based on user-defined categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1. **User Interaction (CLI)**
- Interactive Python script that prompts the user to define:
  - Target image categories (e.g., cats, dogs, cars)
  - Dataset availability
  - Preferred ML framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch)
  - Level of experience with ML concepts

### 2. **Data Preparation**
- Gather and organize a labeled dataset of images.
- Support for user-provided datasets or guidance on sourcing datasets.

### 3. **Model Architecture**
- Design and implement a CNN using TensorFlow’s Keras API.
- Support for standard image input shapes and multiple class outputs.

### 4. **Model Training**
- Train the CNN model using TensorFlow.
- Monitor training with metrics like accuracy and loss.

### 5. **Data Augmentation**
- Apply techniques such as:
  - Rotation
  - Flipping
  - Zooming
  - Brightness adjustment

### 6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Tune learning rate, batch size, epochs, and optimizer to improve performance.

### 7. **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate model using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Confusion Matrix

### 8. **Deployment**
- Export the model for deployment to a web app or mobile application.
- Provide interface for uploading and tagging new images.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `image_tagging_cli.py` – Interactive CLI setup script
- `train_model.py` – (To be implemented) TensorFlow training script
- `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Add GUI interface for category and dataset input
- Integrate pre-trained models (Transfer Learning)
- Add model versioning and experiment tracking (e.g., MLflow)

---

## 📌 Ethical Considerations
- Ensure training data is ethically sourced and unbiased.
- Avoid training models on sensitive or personally identifiable content.
- Validate and verify predictions for critical applications.
