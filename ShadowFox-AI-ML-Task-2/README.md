# 🚗 Car Price Prediction System

This project builds a machine learning model to estimate the **resale value of cars** based on various features. It uses data such as fuel type, years of usage, showroom price, kilometers driven, transmission type, and ownership details to predict an accurate selling price.

---

## 📌 Objective
To develop an intelligent system that can predict the selling price of a car, helping users and sellers make informed decisions in the used car market.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- `Selling_Price`: **Target** — resale value (in lakhs)
- `Present_Price`: Original showroom price (in lakhs)
- `Kms_Driven`: Total distance covered
- `Fuel_Type`: Fuel category (Petrol, Diesel, CNG)
- `Seller_Type`: Seller identity (Dealer or Individual)
- `Transmission`: Gear type (Manual/Automatic)
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners
- `Years_Used`: Derived feature indicating the vehicle's age

---

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Collection
- Gather the dataset containing relevant car attributes.

### 2. Preprocessing
- Handle missing data.
- Drop non-impactful columns (like `Car_Name`).
- Derive the `Years_Used` feature.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize distributions and relationships.
- Use heatmaps to identify correlations with the target.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Encode categorical variables.
- Normalize continuous features if required.

### 5. Train/Test Split
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 6. Model Building
- Apply algorithms like:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
- Random Forest is commonly preferred for its robustness.

### 7. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Improve model accuracy using `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`.

### 8. Evaluation
- Use metrics such as:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score

### 9. Deployment
- Create a prediction interface using **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
- Allow users to input data and get real-time predictions.

### 10. Monitoring & Updates
- Continuously track performance and retrain with fresh data if needed.

## ▶️ Running the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn flask
   ```

2. **Load the Data**:
   - Add `car.csv` (or equivalent) to your project folder.

3. **Run Preprocessing**:
   - Clean, encode, and transform the dataset.

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Execute the training script.

5. **Save the Model**:
   - Use `joblib` or `pickle` to serialize the model for deployment.

6. **Deploy**:
   - Launch a web interface or API using Flask/FastAPI.

## Sample Prediction

**Input Example**:
```json
{
  "Fuel_Type": "Petrol",
  "Present_Price": 8.5,
  "Kms_Driven": 30000,
  "Years_Used": 5,
  "Seller_Type": "Individual",
  "Transmission": "Manual",
  "Owner": 1
}

```

**Predicted Output**:
Selling Price: ₹5.4 lakhs

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add more nuanced features like brand, model, service history.
- Try advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, deep learning).
- Improve UI/UX of the prediction platform.
